# Hello-World
Holding various trading projects in SQL and Python
My name is Bryan Howard and I am primarily using Github to hone and improve my coding skills.  I am relatively new to coding and have self taught myself SQL and am in the process of teaching myself Python.  I would like to use Python for technical analysis for investment purposes, but am open to any project recomendations that others may feel are a better way to showcase those skills.
